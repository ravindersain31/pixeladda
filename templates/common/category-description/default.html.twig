<h2>{{ categoryName }} Custom Yard Signs</h2>
<p>At Yard Sign Plus, we provide high-quality, corrugated plastic yard signs for a wide range of events, holidays, and commercial purposes. We strive to inspire your next design, so be sure to explore our custom {{ categoryName }} signs to find a template to build on or choose our full custom option to start from scratch.</p>

<h2>Durable Materials Made to Last</h2>
<p>We use UV-resistant ink printed onto the corrugated plastic via UV printing, offering vibrant colors and clear messaging. With our full-color printing process, these materials have fade-resistant properties and offer outdoor durability, which can withstand rain and other poor weather conditions.</p>
<p>Each custom yard sign on our site offers the option to add wire stakes to your order. These wire stakes can be a helpful tool for lawn signs that are on display in yards or along streets. By placing the stakes deep in the ground, it helps withstand windy conditions while maintaining visibility.</p>

<h2>Customizable {{ categoryName }} Yard Signage</h2>
<p>We have a wide selection of unique templates to choose from that offer customizable elements such as uploading your own imagery, adding text, selecting fonts, and other visual elements to make your yard sign shine!</p>
<p>Each sign offers a single-sided and double-sided option, which can be a great option if you’re hoping to catch eyes outdoors in local areas or along roadways. You can also opt to have grommets installed in your sign, allowing you to hang your sign rather than planting it in the ground.</p>

<h2>Order Quantity Discounts</h2>
<p>Be sure to check out our order quantity discounts when ordering multiple signs. Whether you’re preparing for a big event or working to expand your reach, we offer cost savings when ordering 5 or more lawn signs.</p>

<h2>Digital Proof and Customer Care</h2>
<p>When submitting an order, we will email you a digital "proof" or preview for your sign for approval. We want to make sure you get the yard sign you were hoping for, so we can only begin production after receiving approval, which is sent in less than 1 hour following your order.</p>
<p>If you notice a configuration error with your order, don’t hesitate to contact our team. We have no minimum order requirements or tax to make sure our customers won’t deal with extra setup or hidden fees.</p>
