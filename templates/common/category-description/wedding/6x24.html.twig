    <h3>Can you help with custom designs or artwork files?</h3>
    <p>Yes, we provide free design assistance for your 6 x 24 signs, including custom artwork creation and proofing.

    <h3>What printing method do you use?</h3>
    <p>We use ultraviolet (UV) printing to apply your designs directly onto 4mm thick, weather-resistant corrugated plastic. The UV light instantly cures the ink, resulting in a smooth, vibrant, and permanent finish. This method ensures full-color customization and is the industry standard for high-quality yard signs.</p>
