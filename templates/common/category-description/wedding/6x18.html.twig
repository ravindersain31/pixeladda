<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="category-faqs">
    <h3>What are Yard Sign Plus custom wedding signs made of?</h3>
    <p>Our custom wedding yard signs are made from corrugated plastic, commonly referred to as coroplast.</p>
    <p>We use ultraviolet (UV) light to cure and dry your custom designs on the corrugated plastic through UV printing. The ink is instantly cured with UV light, resulting in a smooth, seamless, embedded, and vibrant finish. This is the most advanced printing technique in the industry.</p>

    <p>You can also order one or more of your specific designs directly from our editor pages, as most products have no minimum order requirements. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to call us at +1-877-958-1499.</p>
