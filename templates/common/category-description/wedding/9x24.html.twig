<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="category-faqs">
    <h3>What is your turnaround time?</h3>
    <p>We pride ourselves on faster turnaround times compared to industry standards. While typical production and shipping of yard signs can take 10-21 days elsewhere, we complete the order process in 1-5 business days, depending on quantity. You can select your preferred delivery date when ordering. Our turnaround begins after payment and proof approval. We aim to create and send proofs within an hour on average.</p>

    <h3>Do your signs include corrugated holes or flutes for inserting wire stakes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, our 9x24 corrugated plastic signs come with built-in flutes or holes along the top and bottom edges. These are designed to accommodate wire stakes, enabling easy installation. Wire stakes are compatible with these holes and can be ordered separately. If you’re looking for something more specific, like spider stakes instead of wire stakes, please contact us to see if your spider stakes order is possible.</p>

    <h3>Do you assist with custom designs or artwork files?</h3>
    <p>We offer complimentary expert design assistance, including custom artwork creation and free proofs. After you submit an order, we'll send a proof for your review, and you can request changes before approving it for production.</p>

    <h3>What printing method do you use?</h3>
    <p>We utilize UV (ultraviolet) printing as our standard method. This involves directly printing designs onto 4mm thick corrugated plastic, with UV light instantly curing the ink. The result is a smooth, vibrant, durable finish that withstands outdoor conditions.</p>

    <h3>Can I save my design to return and work on it later?</h3>
    <p>You can save your 9x24 corrugated plastic sign design before finalizing your order. Our editor page provides a "Save Your Design" option, allowing you to receive an email link valid for 30 days. Alternatively, you can choose "See Design - Pay Later" at checkout to submit your order without immediate payment. You can make changes or add new artwork before approving the final proof. Contact our customer service team via phone, email, or live chat for assistance.</p>
