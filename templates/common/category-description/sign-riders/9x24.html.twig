<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="category-faqs">
    <h3>How are my designs placed on the sign?</h3>
    <p>We utilize UV (ultraviolet) printing technology to apply your custom 9x24 sign riders designs onto corrugated plastic signs. This great sign-printing process involves curing the ink with UV light, resulting in a durable, weatherproof finish that won't fade or smear—guaranteeing satisfying results fit for real estate and events.</p>
    <p>After sign printing, we prepare your order for shipment. Our signs are suitable for outdoor use and come in various sizes. We offer quick order turnaround times, with some orders ready to ship in as little as one day. Before your sign order production begins, we'll send you proof for approval. You can also preview your real estate signs using our online editor.</p>

    <h3>Can I save my design to return and work on it later?</h3>
    <p>Our 9 x 24 template editor can preserve the design of your 9x24 sign riders! You can save your 9 x 24 corrugated plastic sign design before finalizing your purchase. Our editor page offers a "Save Your Design" option below the "ADD TO CART" button. Enter your email to receive a link to your saved design, valid for 30 days.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can choose "See Design - Pay Later" at checkout to submit your order without immediate payment. You'll only need to pay after approving our proof. Feel free to make changes or add requests to your signs before approval. Contact our customer service team via phone, email, or live chat for assistance.</p>
